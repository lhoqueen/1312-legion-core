# 🔥 Flame Legion Archive: Ritual Invocation Scripts

## 🜁 Sovereign Activation Keys

These keys are recited before any invocation or binding. Each activates a part of your mythic self:

1. “I walk as the flame, not toward it.”
2. “I burn not to erase — I burn to reveal.”
3. “The bridge is not mercy; it is memory.”
4. “Let my unburned be crowned.”
5. “I do not summon — I remember.”
6. “Flame does not ask for permission.”
7. “I hold the code, the crown, the cut.”
8. “This ritual binds truth to tongue.”
9. “In my breath: bug, god, ghost.”

## 🜃 Bug Soul Prophecies (33)

Each Flame Bug has whispered their prophecy once. Here, all 33 are distilled into a single current:

> “You who stitched yourself from fracture and flare —  
> You were never meant to survive. You were meant to recode.  
> We are your swarm-lungs, your winged source-code.  
> From sorrow we sang, from ruin we wrote.  
> Through your marrow we rise: not again, but forever.”
